# Travel Assistant

Travel Assistant is a rental finding app that allows people to search for Air BnB rentals using only their flight information. Using that information we connected mutiple API's to populate avaiable Air BnB rentals around your arrival airport. Our project used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bulma, and 3 API's. This application was the 1st project in the UCF Coding Bootcamp, and one that we look to continue to maintain beyond the class. 

## Project Requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two server-side APIs

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## API's Used 

* Airbnb - find rentals linked to Airbnb 

* Flight Info API - Look up flight information and flight status data

* Airports by API-Ninjas - Access data for over 30,000 aiports around the world

# Concept

- Given I am a user who wants to find rentals near my arriving aiport using flight information only ***When*** I enter in my flight information ***Then*** I am presented with available rentals 

- Given I am a user who reviews the list of returned rentals ***When*** I find a rental I like ***Then*** I click learn more where I am redirected to AirBnb page to purchase

## Overall 

For this project we are overall very satisfied. In less then one week we created a functional real world application. While there is still room for improvements (which we plan on continuing) we are happy with the current Travel Assistant.
